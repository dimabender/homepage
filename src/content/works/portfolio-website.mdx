I decided to create a personal portfolio website to make it easier for people to understand who they’re about to work with. Instead of sending scattered links or explaining my background every time, I wanted one place where everything comes together — my projects, my experience, and the things I’m currently building.

Another big part of it was having a space that actually feels like me. A website where the visuals, the structure, and the little details reflect my vibe and how I approach my work. It’s not just a collection of projects — it’s a way for people to get a sense of my style before we even start talking.

For the tech stack, I ended up choosing SolidJS. Its speed and optimization instantly caught my attention, and the familiar React-like syntax made it super easy to jump in without changing the way I think about components. It felt like the right mix of performance and comfort, so it became the foundation of this site.
