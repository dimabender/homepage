When I first started learning Rust, an old idea resurfaced — creating an app that converts images into ASCII art. I began with a simple terminal version to understand how the whole process works. After that, I wanted a proper interface so others could use it easily and without hassle.

I ended up building the web version entirely in Rust as well, using a library that makes it possible to write full web applications in Rust.
