The first step in my journey into graphics was building a small engine based on the classic DDA algorithm used in Wolfenstein 3D and Doom. I wanted to understand how everything works under the hood — from ray calculations to scene rendering. Eventually, I put together my own mini-engine in Rust using the SFML library, and this project gave me a solid foundation for diving deeper into graphics programming.
