During my internship, I worked as a full-stack developer on a data management application. We used React on the frontend and Java on the backend.

The team originally consisted of six people, but in practice only two of us — myself and another teammate — were able to handle the development tasks. Because of that, most of the workload ended up on us. We planned the architecture, split responsibilities, implemented the frontend, built the backend, and connected everything into a functioning product.

Even though the workload was higher than expected, this internship gave me solid hands-on experience. Working essentially as a two-person development team taught us how to adapt quickly, stay organized, and make decisions without slowing down the process. Combining React and Java in one project also helped me better understand how both sides of the application interact in a real environment.
