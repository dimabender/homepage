In college, I studied several areas related to programming and IT. We covered web development, software development, databases, basic graphics, network technologies, and many other practical topics. Alongside that, we worked with Arduino, combining code with hardware, testing circuits, and building simple prototypes.

Team projects were a regular part of the workflow — assigning roles, planning tasks, and bringing everything to a finished state. This gave me a solid understanding of how collaborative development works and what a proper workflow looks like.

A key stage was my course project, which involved developing a full application from the initial idea to the final presentation. I went through the entire cycle — planning, architecture, implementation, testing, and documentation — which helped me understand development as a complete process.

This is also where my interest in computer graphics started. During one of the classes, the topic caught my attention, and I realized I wanted to dive deeper into this field.
