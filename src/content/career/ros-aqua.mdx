At my job, I worked on developing a LIMS system primarily as a backend developer, but I also helped with frontend tasks when needed. During this time, I learned new frameworks, picked up a lot of practical experience from my colleagues, and significantly improved my overall workflow and skills.

My main responsibilities included building routes and middleware, designing the database structure, optimizing algorithms, and refining the application’s core logic. From time to time, I also worked on the client side — fixing bugs or implementing small components — which helped me better understand how everything connects across the stack.

This experience gave me a deeper understanding of architecture, team workflows, and how a full product is built and maintained.
