I completed an in-person course on Go. It wasn’t my first programming language — before that, I had already worked with JavaScript and created Discord bots, so getting into Go was fairly easy for me. At the time, though, the language didn’t really click with me. Its logic and minimalism felt a bit unusual and not very appealing.

As I gained more experience and explored different technologies, my perspective changed. Now I understand the strengths of Go: its simplicity, clear structure, performance, and how well it fits for building services. With that in mind, my attitude toward the language has become much more positive — I see why it’s valued and consider it a solid, well-designed tool.
