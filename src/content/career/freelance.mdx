In my freelance work, I handle a variety of projects — from websites to small mobile applications. My main stack revolves around TypeScript and popular frameworks, but depending on the task, I also work with Java, Kotlin, and Python. This variety helps me stay flexible and switch quickly between different types of work.

Constant communication with clients taught me how to structure the process properly: clarifying requirements, planning stages, explaining technical details, and keeping a steady pace. At the same time, I’m improving my skills in architecture, API design, backend development, frontend implementation, and overall project organization.

Freelancing continues to be a solid way for me to grow, expand my tech stack, and work on tasks that give real, hands-on experience rather than theory.
