During my internship, we worked on developing small full-stack applications and also practiced using artificial intelligence tools in Python. We experimented with image recognition, video processing, and live camera interaction, testing different models and learning how to apply them in real scenarios.

The format was focused on learning: we were split into teams of two, shared tasks, discussed solutions, and went through the whole process together — from the initial idea to a working prototype. This helped me understand teamwork better, take responsibility for my part of the project, and find solutions faster through collaboration.

The internship gave me solid hands-on experience with full-cycle development and introduced me to practical ways of using AI tools in real projects.
